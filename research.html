              <h5>From bricklayers to waiters: labor market adjustment of Spanish workers during The Great Recession
              </h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">
              This paper analyzes the impact on worker’s employment and earnings trajectories
              caused by the employment contraction of the Spanish construction sector
              during the Great Recession. Moreover, it quantifies the relevance of the interaction
              between worker skills and local sectoral composition on the worker’s labour market
              adjustment during the same period. The identification strategy exploits variation
              in the construction sector’s employment contraction across Spanish provinces and
              a rich set of worker characteristics available in administrative panel data (CSWL).
              I show that individuals initially employed in the construction sector experienced a
              large impact on their cumulative wages during Spain’s economic downturn. This
              impact resulted from longer unemployment and non-employment spells rather than
              a decrease in the average wages of exposed workers. Supported on the previous
              results, I study to what extent the local sectoral composition contributes to alleviating
              the shock’s impact on worker’s outcomes. The results suggest that earnings
              losses are larger for workers in provinces where the sectoral composition provides
              fewer opportunities to change sectors. Furthermore, the reallocation probabilities
              depend on the interaction of worker and regional characteristics. One implication
              of these findings is that high sectoral concentrations in a region may harm worker’s
              outcomes in case of a sectoral shock. Finally, these findings support that short
              term labour market adjustments are mainly intersectoral rather than inter-regional,
              consistent with recent empirical evidence in other settings.

              <h5>Trends in inequality: A national and disaggregated earnings inequality study for Spain, 1980-2016</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">This article studies the evolution of Spain’s wage inequality between 1995 and
              2017, emphasizing differences in trends at cohorts, sectors, and regional levels
              and using data of Spain’s Continues Sample of Working Histories (Muestra
              Continua de Vidas Laborales MCVL). This dataset allows studying how broad
              changes in inequality are decomposed at a disaggregated level. The results suggest
              that wage inequality in Spain is strongly countercyclical. After the Great
              Recession, the earnings distribution became even more unequal, this is appreciated
              over all the autonomous communities, especially Andalusia, where the
              construction sector was relatively more important, in opposition the North of
              Spain has a higher percentage of the highly educated workers, and less dependent
              on the construction sector before the crisis. Possible explanations for the documented
              evolution in earnings inequality are the evolution of the unemployment
              rate and the development of the college wage premium.

              <h5>Wage growth in a dual labor market</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">Do opportunities to acquire general skills differ substantially across types of contracts? If so, what are the implications for young workers' skill accumulation and wage growth? The unusual proportion of workers in fixed-term contracts in many European countries offer an excellent case of study for such questions. This article studies how the experience accumulated in fixed-term and open-ended contracts affects the labor market trajectories of workers. Using Spanish Social Security data, I find that returns to experience in fixed-term and open-ended contracts are initially similar. However, workers who stay longer in fixed-term contracts get steadily lower returns, creating an earnings gap for similar workers with different labor market experiences. The evidence points out that a simple job ladder channel does not fully explain this gap, compatible with previous evidence that workers in fixed-term contracts receive less on-the-job training than workers in open-ended contracts. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that college-educated and high-skilled workers suffer the biggest impact from acquiring more experience in fixed-term contracts, but this is also present in low educated and low-skilled workers.
