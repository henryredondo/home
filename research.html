            </a>
            <div class="articles">
              This paper explores how the local sectoral composition influences workers' adjustment
              to a large economic shock. I exploit the massive burst in the Spanish construction sector
              during the Great Recession, using detailed longitudinal administrative data. The identification
              strategy relies on regional variations in employment contraction for the construction sector,
              across Spanish provinces. The construction workers in heavily exposed provinces suffered a
              significant decline in total earnings between 2007 and 2012, consistent with the workers
              experiencing long periods of unemployment rather than wage cuts. I find evidence that this
              short-term labor market adjustment was intersectoral rather than interregional, even under
              asymmetric exposure. In order to understand the role of sectoral composition in an individual
              worker's response to the shock, I construct a <i> reallocation index </i>  based on worker
              characteristics and local employment size within the sector. This index captures the degree
              to which workers from the construction sector can reallocate into other sectors. Then, I examine
               how sectoral composition contributes to ameliorating the shock's impact. I provide evidence
                that workers' likelihood of changing sectors depends on having better outside opportunities
                in other sectors, which varies across provinces and worker's characteristics. Individuals
                with more evenly distributed characteristics across sectors were less affected by the shock
                because they were more likely to change sectors. This implies that workers are less likely
                to adapt to shocks when a region has a high level of sectoral concentration.

              <h5>Wage growth in a dual labor market</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">In this paper, we present evidence consistent with large
              differences in returns to experience between permanent and temporary contracts
               in Spain. Using Spanish Social Security records, we track workers since
               labor market entry and compute their cumulative experience in both contract types.
                To deal with the non-random sorting of workers into contract types, we propose
                a novel instrument that exploits quasi-random variation in matches by interacting
                 with high-frequency information on the duration of contracts and fluctuations
                  in job creation. Our results show that the opening of permanent contracts is
                   highly predictive of the promotion probabilities into those contracts (timing
                   effects), which has long-lasting effects on earnings, employment, and the
                   accumulation of experience in permanent positions. Finally, we explore the
                   returns to experience by contract type; preliminary results show heterogeneous
                    returns to experience by contract type, with fixed-term contracts being more
                     harmful to more experienced workers.

              <h5>Internal migration and job instability</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">This paper explores the relationship between
              job instability and workers' internal migration. In many Eastern
               European countries, low promotion rates from temporary to permanent
               positions affect workers' job security, a concern that is magnified
               for young workers. Due to the uncertainty of migration benefits,
               which heavily depend on promotions, they may be discouraged from
               migrating. By using Spanish provinces as a laboratory, this paper
               examines how job uncertainty affects internal migration within the
               country. Using detailed administrative longitudinal data, I can observe
               all worker movements each month. As a result, I can study both short-
               and long-term migration movements, which provides new evidence on the
               relationship between job flexibility and migration. According to my
               results, increasing job flexibility increases short-term immigration
               while deterring workers from staying longer. One percentage point higher
               share of fixed-term contracts implies a seven percentage point lower
               inflow into the province. Finally, by exploring individual-level data,
                I show job security is an important determinant of a worker's internal
                mobility.
